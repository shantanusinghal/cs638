py_entitymatching
=================

Entity matching (EM) is a critical problem and will become even more critical.
Lot of EM research, but has focused mostly
on matching algorithms. Focus mostly on maximizing some performance factors 
such as accuracy, time, money, etc. Currently there is very little help for 
users. For many of these steps, there is little or no work, so no solution. 
Even when there are solutions, there may be no tools. Even when there are 
tools, user is faced with a wide variety of tools, one for each step, so 
user is left trying to move among the tools, stitching them together, 
deciphering their different data formats, import/export commands. too 
cumbersome and difficult. So often users just give up and roll their own 
ad-hoc solutions instead. This is obviously a major bottleneck that prevents
the deployment of matching in practice. To solve the above problems, 
py_entitymatching aims to provide a set of commands that help the user to
 
* Come up with a EM workflow
* Iterate and debugmatcher the workflow
* Deploy it in production 


The package is free, open-source, and BSD-licensed.
